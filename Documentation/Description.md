# Photo Shares

This is a photo sharing project for my CS460 class, SUMMER term I 2017. It is a **photo sharing web application**. User can upload images, browse images in the system and leave comments.

## Purpose
The app allows simple photo sharing. It provides a system that store images submitted by registered users. So each user can browse his own image or image submitted by other users.

## For registered users

To begin, user needs to register an account. After sign in with his account, user can can manage his account in the following way:

1. Create albums and upload images to albums under his account. When uploading images, the user needs to give a name, and there's an option of adding up to 3 tags for every image.

2. Delete images, albums, or comments. When an album is deleted, all of his images are also deleted.

3. Browse all images in the system or search images by tags. If the user likes the image, he can leave comment and click the *like* button.

4. If the user's friends also have account, the user can add his friend to his account.

5. Get random recommended images by the system. The recommendation is made based on the most frequent tags used by the user.


## For guests

Since guest doesn't have an account. He can only browse the images in the system, or search images by tag.

## In the main page
The app automatically generates the statistic of tags and user's activity. In specific, the app will display the top 10 frequented tags and also the top 10 active users in the main page.
